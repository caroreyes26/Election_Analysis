## Project Overview 
Colorado Board of Elections has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. County that had the largest number of votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

## Challenge Summary
The script created using Python is ideal for automating counting the votes casted in the election and getting additional data. Once the csv file is uploaded with the data, the script created is able to report on the total number of votes cast, largest number of votes, percentages by candidate, and determing the winner of the election. The script also provides the amount of votes per county, which is helpful to see the counties with low turnout rates to plan a strategy to increase voter turnout in the future. It is recommended that the Colorado Board of Elections keeps using the script in future elections and builds on the data collected and presented.
